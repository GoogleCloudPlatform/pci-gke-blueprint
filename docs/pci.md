# PCI DSS Requirements

## This PCI DSS Requirements table describes the requirements at are addressed by the PCI on GKE Blueprint project. It does not address all requirements, some are inherited from Google, while others would need to be implement. Free free to submit a PR for requirements we have not addressed

| PCI DSS Blueprints<br>Standardized GKE - based architecture for PCI-DSS on GCP<br><br>The control mapping helps you assess compliance with a PCI requirement; however, there often isn't a one-for-one mapping or complete match between a control implemented in the blueprint and the PCI requirement.It is important to note that the description of the implementation details in this blueprints must be reviewed, evaluated, assessed, and approved by your and your QSA, and layered with other security features that address all of the in-scope systems and applications for a holistic solution to meet the PCI requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This excludes public-facing areas where only point-of-sale terminals are present, such as the cashier areas in a retail store.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Additional documentation may be required to verify non-remediated vulnerabilities are in the process of being addressed.<br>For initial PCI DSS compliance, it is not required that four quarters of passing scans be completed if the assessor verifies 1) the most recent scan result was a passing scan, 2) the entity has documented policies and procedures requiring quarterly scanning, and 3) vulnerabilities noted in the scan results have been corrected as shown in a re-scan(s).
